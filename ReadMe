How it Works:
Classes and Objects:

The Book class represents a book with attributes like id, title, author, and a flag isBorrowed to track if the book is borrowed.

The LibraryManagementSystem class manages the entire library system using an ArrayList to store the books and various methods to add, view, borrow, return, and remove books.

ArrayList:

An ArrayList<Book> is used to hold the list of books. It allows dynamic resizing and makes it easier to manage books in memory during the program's runtime.

Menu-Driven Program:

A menu is presented to the user with various options to add a book, view books, borrow/return books, and remove books from the library.

The user can interact with the system through a simple text interface in the console.

Borrow/Return:

Borrowing a book marks it as borrowed and prevents it from being borrowed again until itâ€™s returned.

Returning a book marks it as available again for others to borrow.
